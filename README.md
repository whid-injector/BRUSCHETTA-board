Bruschetta-Board has been designed by [Luca Bongiorni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucabongiorni) and made available by the awesome guys from https://www.aprbrother.com/ for any hardware hacker out there that is looking for a fairly-priced all-in-one debugger & programmer that supports: UART, JTAG, I2C & SPI protocols and allows to interact with different targets' voltages (i.e., 1.8, 2.5, 3.3 and 5 Volts!).<br>

## Operating Modes
BRUSCHETTA-board has 4 Operating Modes, however the ones that you will need most are Mode 2 (UART1+I2C+SPI-VCP) and Mode 4 (UART1+JTAG).
**To switch between them you have to set use the DPI-switch S1 & S2:<br>**

**- Mode 2 (UART1+I2C+SPI-VCP): S1=ON and S2=OFF<br>**
    Before starting using your BRUSCHETTA-Board as SPI or I2C Programmer... you will have to change the mode:
    
          • Switch it to Mode-2 by setting the DIP switch S1 to ON and the S2 to OFF (see image below);
          
          • Set the target voltage level (which in the case below was 3.3V);
          
          • Set the Jumper of the Chip Select to CS0.

**- Mode 4 (UART1+JTAG): S1=ON and S2=ON<br>**
    To use it as UART and JTAG debugger (both working at the same time) you will have to set both S1 & S2 to ON.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT REMINDER** ⚠️
If you plan to use the BRUSCHETTA-Board as UART and/or JTAG debugger REMEMBER to first unplug any I2C and SPI device that may keep busy the data lines!!!
Otherwise it will create communication issues!!!<br>
  
## Level Shifters
A nice feature of BRUSCHETTA-board that makes it perfect for Hardware Hackers is the fact it mounts Level Shifters.<br>
No matter if you have to use it for UART, JTAG, SPI or I2C... if you target is working at 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V or 5V... BRUSCHETTA-board is here to help you! You just need to move the Level Shifter Jumper to the target's voltage BEFORE connecting it to the device and the PC.<br>

## Windows
**Drivers Installation**<br>
Before plugging the BRUSCHETTA-board on a Windows OS do install the driver CH341PAR.EXE<br>

**SPI - SPI-NAND PROG**<br>
https://github.com/981213/spi-nand-prog<br>

**JTAG & SWD - OpenOCD**<br>

This is the official repo from the IC manufacturer, however I do recommend to use the openocd repo within mine Github repository since it was succesfully compiled and tested with BRUSCHETTA-board <br>
https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch347<br>

```cd ~/Desktop```<br>
```git clone https://github.com/whid-injector/BRUSCHETTA-Board```<br>
```cd BRUSCHETTA-Board```<br>
```mkdir openocd-ch347```<br>
```cd Linux/openocd-bruschetta```<br>
```./bootstrap```<br>
```./configure --prefix=/home/<YOUR-USER>/Desktop/BRUSCHETTA-Board/openocd-ch347 --disable-doxygen-html --disable-doxygen-pdf --disable-gccwarnings --disable-wextra --enable-ch347```<br>
```make -j 4```<br>
```sudo make install```<br>

Now copy bruschetta-openocd.cfg in ```/home/<YOUR-USER>/Desktop/BRUSCHETTA-Board/openocd-ch347/bin```<br>

```sudo ./openocd -f bruschetta-openocd.cfg -f TARGET.cfg```<br><br>

**I2C - Ch347eeprom**<br>
```git clone https://github.com/whid-injector/ch347eeprom```<br>
```cd ch347eeprom```<br>
```make```<br>


```sudo ./ch347eeprom -v -s 24c08 -r firmware.bin```<br><br>

## Tips & Tricks
In case you plan to use BRUSCHETTA-Board on a VM I do recommend to enable the USB3.0 controller.<br><br>

## 3D Printed Case
In this repo you can find the STL CAD file to print your own case for BRUSCHETTA-board. <br>
Ifyou do not own a 3D printer... there are plenty of cheap services out there. <br>
If you live in EU, I do love the guys from [Craftrum](https://www.craftrum.eu), they already printed ton of cases for me 🥇<br>
The screws used are a 2x6mm Flat-Head Screws (e.g. https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEYh5yR) <br>

# How to report bugs:
I won't spend time explaining in depth how to report issues, since I am pretty sure you have done it tons of times. 
The main idea can be summed up in the following points:
1. Expected Behavior
2. Unexpected Behavior
3. which OS you using?
4. (Windows) Did you install the drivers before connecting?
5. (Windows) Did you try all the tools? Multiprogrammer, BruschettaTool.exe and Flashrom?
6. (Windows) Is the SPI/I2C flash connected properly? Is on-PCB? Or detached from the DUT?
7. Is the target computer an Apple Product?
8. Is the target USB port an USB3.0?
9. Eventual Explanation Notes, Screenshots, Videos, etc.
